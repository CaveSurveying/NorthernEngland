# LeckMasongill survex data files

This subdirectory contains survex data files for the Leck Fell and
Masongill cave systems.

These have been modified from the originals in the Cave Registry Data
Archive so that the individual caves now break at the cave
descriptions in the new edition of Northern Caves, and duplicate /
splay legs have been identified and flagged.  This means that the cave
lengths can be computed automatically.

For convenience the cave statistics generated by running the
Makefile in [unixtools](../unixtools) against this data set have been
imported into the spreadsheet
[`LeckMasongill_statistics.ods`](LeckMasongill_statistics.ods).

The dataset is georeferenced at the top level (in
`LeckMasongill.svx`) to the OSGB 1936 British National Grid, with
EPSG code 7405.  An associated GeoPackage `LeckMasongill.gpkg`, generated by
importing `LeckMasongill.3d` into QGIS3, is also provided for
convenience.
