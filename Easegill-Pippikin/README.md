# Easegill / Pippikin survex data files

This subdirectory contains survex data files for the connected
components of the Lancaster Hole / Easegill / Pippikin Pot system.

These have been modified from the originals in the Cave Registry Data
Archive so that the individual caves now break at the cave
descriptions in the new edition of Northern Caves, and duplicate
passages have been flagged.  This means that the cave lengths can be
computed automatically.
