# Easegill-Pippikin survex data files

This subdirectory contains survex data files for the connected
components of the Lancaster Hole / Easegill / Pippikin Pot system.

These have been modified from the originals in the Cave Registry Data
Archive so that the individual caves now break at the cave
descriptions in the new edition of Northern Caves, and duplicate /
splay legs have been identified and flagged.  This means that cave
lengths can be computed automatically.  A complete list of these
changes (which affect the claimed length of the system) is given in
`duplicates.dat`.

For convenience the tab-delimited text files `caves.dat`, `table.dat`,
and `duplicates.dat`, as generated by the scripts in [unixtools](../unixtools),
have been imported into the spreadsheet
[`Easegill-Pippikin_statistics.ods`](Easegill-Pippikin_statistics.ods).

The dataset is georeferenced at the top level (in
`Easegill-Pippikin.svx`) to the OSGB 1936 British National Grid, with
EPSG code 7405.

The `.3d` file and associated GeoPackage `.gpkg` (from QGIS3) are
provided for convenience.
